        <p class="inconsolata-paragraphs paragraph">
            In the realm of video games and consoles, homebrew refers to software produced by hobbyists for proprietary video game systems.<br><br>
            Typically within the space of video game consoles, development tools and documentation is only provided to licensed developers by the manufacturer, 
            leading to only software written by game companies and game developers to be run on the system.<br><br>
            However, through the use of modifications to the hardware of these proprietary systems, modders have found ways to allow homebrew developers to write, run and execute code for these systems without the need for a license and development kit.
