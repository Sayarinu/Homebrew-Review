        <h1 class="anta-regular title">What is Homebrew?</h1>
        <p class="inconsolata-paragraphs paragraph">
            In the realm of video games and consoles, homebrew refers to software produced by hobbyists for proprietary video game systems.<br><br>
            Typically within the space of video game consoles, development tools and documentation is only provided to licensed developers by the manufacturer, 
            leading to only software written by game companies and game developers to be run on the system.<br><br>
            However, through the use of modifications to the hardware of these proprietary systems, modders have found ways to allow homebrew developers to write, run and execute code for these systems without the need for a license and development kit.
        </p>
        <h1 class="anta-regular title">What can you do with Homebrew?</h1>
        <p class="inconsolata-paragraphs paragraph">
            Through the use of homebrew software, you are able to use the device in many ways. To explore the options available to the user, we will explore functionalities added to the PlayStation Vita through the use of homebrew software.
        </p>
        <h1 class="anta-regular subheading">Custom Themes</h1>
        <p class="inconsolata-paragraphs paragraph">
            Themes are a native feature of the PlayStation Vita and allows the user to purchase themes developed by licensed developers for a small charge.<br><br>
            Through the use of a homebrew software called <a class="linkClean" href="https://vstema.com/"  target="_blank">Tema,</a> regular users are allowed to
            to browse, upload, and install custom themes created by the community and add it to their own device. 
            People are now able to create themes with thier favorite characters or add in themes developed by others that they like 
            to their system to make thier console more unique to themselves.

        <h1 class="anta-regular subheading">Overclocking</h1>
        <p class="inconsolata-paragraphs paragraph">
            As game developers continue to push the graphics in their games, oftentimes there can be performance hiccups and visual inconsistencies that arise from optimization taking a backfoot to the visuals in development.
            One way to increase the performance of a device's processing output is through overclocking.<br><br>
            Overclocking is a process of manually increasing the clock speed of a hardware component, primarily the device's CPU or Memory. With the use of custom firmware you are allowed to overclock your devices and squeeze
            out a little extra performance to help run these games at a more acceptable framerate which smoothens the gaming experience.<br><br>
            Note that prolonged use of overclocking can lead to decreased lifespan of your device in the longrun. However this is not a drastic change and should not be considered a serious concern.
        </p>
        <h1 class="anta-regular subheading">Online Services</h1>
        <p class="inconsolata-paragraphs paragraph">
            In the modern video game landscape, many video games often have online aspects or the entire game is an online experience.<br><br>
            When the developers of these games no longer want to provide the services for these games, some of these games can effectively become unplayable.<br><br>
            Many of the communities behind these games are able to leverage homebrew software to host servers for these games and allow players with a modified system to play these games online once again.
        </p>
        <h1 class="anta-regular subheading">Much More</h1>
        <p class="inconsolata-paragraphs paragraph">
            While these are great reasons to get into homebrew and modding of your system it isn't an exhaustive list of the stuff you can do with a modded system.<br><br>
            We hope that you choose to mod your systems and explore the wonderful software homebrew developers have created.
